          <p className='w-full'>I&apos;m a visual storyteller with a sharp eye for composition,
            color, and motion. With experience across tools like Photoshop,
            Illustrator, After Effects, and Canva, I craft visuals
            that don&apos;t just look goodâ€”they communicate. Whether it&apos;s
            designing standout social posts, sleek UI assets, or cinematic
            edits, I focus on clarity, emotion, and purpose. I approach each
            project with intention, blending design principles with instinct
            to create visuals that resonate.
